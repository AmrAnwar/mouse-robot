# mouse-robot
we have 2 stage

- Our robot take maze data and from any point will take the shortest path from this pointusing way similar to **dead and learn ** algorithm....check (**final_stage_1** ) file & **dead_lrn.c** & **solce_maze.ino**  

- or put it in random place and the robot will detect the location using the **JAVA code** then work using the first stage to go out.
