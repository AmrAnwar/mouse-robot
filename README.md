we have 2 stage

- Our robot take maze data and from any point will take the shortest path from this point check (**final_stage_1** ) file using way similar to **dead_lrn** algorithm... 

- or put it in random place and the robot will detect the location using the **JAVA code** then work using the first stage to go out.
